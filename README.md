This real-time chat app includes a wide range of modern messaging features. Users can log in and out through a simple LocalStorage-based authentication system. The app supports private one-on-one messaging and group chats, with functionality to create new groups and add or remove members dynamically. It allows users to share files and images — images are previewed within the chat and can be viewed full screen or downloaded, while other file types are shared with download links. Every message comes with delivery and read indicators (✅ for sent, ✅✅ for read), and group messages even display a list of users who have read the message. Users can forward messages to others, delete them, and see unread message counts for each conversation. The layout is optimized with sticky headers and input sections to keep the interface intuitive and easy to use. On top of this, a sleek, modern UI powered by Bootstrap ensures the chat app feels polished and responsive across devices.
The project is organized into two main folders: chat-frontend and chat-backend. The frontend is built using React and is located in the chat-frontend directory. Inside it, the public folder contains static assets such as 7648244.png, which is displayed on the empty chat screen, while the src folder contains all React components and application logic, including the main App.js and entry point index.js. The backend, if used, is placed in the chat-backend folder and is built with Node.js and Socket.IO, handling real-time messaging logic and optionally storing user data or message history. This structure allows for clear separation between frontend presentation and backend logic.
